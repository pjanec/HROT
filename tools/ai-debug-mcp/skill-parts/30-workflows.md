## 3. Canonical workflows (compose these — they are the point of the API)

### A. Load and inspect
1. `load_scenario {name:"test-move", waitForReady:true}` — blocks until the world is loaded (Edit state).
2. `list_entities` → pick a `networkId`. (Filter with `component` / `near` to avoid dumping everything.)
3. `get_entity {networkId}` → full component dump.

### B. Drive and observe (the safe, deterministic loop)
1. `enter_preview {startPaused:true}` (or `play` then `pause`).
2. Send an action: `send_entity_command {...}` or `spawn_entity {...}`. (While paused these are queued.)
3. `step {count:N}` to advance N ticks and actually process them.
4. `get_entity` / `get_event_history` to observe the result.
Repeat 2–4. This gives you reproducible, frame-by-frame control. (`play` runs free; `pause` to stop.)

### C. Run until a condition (auto-pause)
1. `set_breakpoint {condition:{...SearchPredicateDto...}}` → returns `breakpointId`.
2. `play`.
3. Poll `get_breakpoint_status` → when `isPaused:true`, the condition fired; `lastHit` names the entity.
4. Inspect, then `remove_breakpoint {id}` and continue.

### D. Experiment and revert (try something, undo it)
1. `checkpoint` (snapshots the world; enters preview, paused).
2. Mutate / spawn / `step` to run your experiment.
3. `restore_checkpoint` → the world rewinds to the snapshot exactly. The experiment is undone.
> Note: a mutation only "sticks" into the snapshot's dirty-tracking after a `step` — in practice you step to
> run the experiment anyway, so this is automatic.

### E. State diff (what changed, cheaply)
1. `capture_diff_baseline` → `baselineId` (serializes current entity state).
2. Do something (move, spawn, step).
3. `diff_state {baselineId}` → a tree of only the changed components (plus entity births/deaths).

### F. Record and replay (post-mortem)
1. `start_recording {mode:"preview"}` → enters preview + begins recording; returns `fdpPath`.
2. `play` / `step` to record some frames.
3. `stop_recording` → finalizes the `.fdp` (and rewinds, since it's preview); returns `fdpPath`.
4. `load_replay {fdpPath}` → isolated sandbox; `get_replay_status` shows `totalFrames`.
5. `seek_replay {frame}` / `step_replay {dir}` → move through it; `list_replay_entities` to inspect a frame.
6. `unload_replay` when done. The live world was never touched.

### G. Inspect AI behavior (BTree/HSM/blueprint)
1. `observe_trace {networkId, on:true}` — **arms** tracing (allocates trace buffers). Without this, traces
   are empty.
2. `play` / `step` a few frames so the buffer fills.
3. `get_entity_trace {networkId}` → active node/state + recent history.
4. `observe_trace {networkId, on:false}` to disarm.

### H. Mutate / fault-inject
- Discoverable, safe path: `get_attributes_schema` → see patchable paths → `patch_attribute {networkId,
  patchJson:{...}}` (authority-aware; unregistered keys ignored).
- Escape hatch (any component field): `edit_component {networkId, componentType, patch:{...}}` (validated;
  invalid values rejected with 400).

### I. Author a scenario
1. `list_entity_types` → choose a `tkbType`. `get_entity_type {tkbType}` for its components.
2. `get_world_info` for the geo origin + placement extent; `geo_to_local`/`local_to_geo` to convert coords.
3. `spawn_entity {tkbType, transform}` (step to process); `patch_attribute` to set Name/Affiliation/etc.
4. `save_scenario {name}`.
