## 5. Gotchas (the things that actually trip agents up)

1. **Time is frozen in Edit state.** `step`/commands do nothing visible until `enter_preview` + `play`.
   Check `get_sim_state.inPreview`.
2. **Arm traces first.** `get_entity_trace` is empty unless you `observe_trace{on:true}` and then step.
3. **`awaited:false, reason:"sim not running"` is not an error** — it means time wasn't advancing; pause-step
   to observe results instead of waiting.
4. **One preview slot.** Don't `checkpoint` while in preview, or `start_recording` while checkpointed.
   Restore/stop first.
5. **Replay never affects the live world** — and the live world never affects replay. Use
   `list_replay_entities` (not `list_entities`) while replaying.
6. **`patch_attribute` keys must be registered** (see `get_attributes_schema`); unregistered keys are silently
   ignored. For arbitrary fields use `edit_component`.
7. **Non-finite floats** appear as the strings `"NaN"`/`"Infinity"`/`"-Infinity"` in dumps — that's valid
   JSON and tells you a field is non-finite (often a real sim signal), not a serialization bug.
8. **Spawns/commands while paused are queued** — they take effect on the next `step`/`play`.
9. **`live` recording is unavailable** in editor mode; use `mode:"preview"`.
10. **Always `stop_simulation`** when finished so no runner process is left behind.
