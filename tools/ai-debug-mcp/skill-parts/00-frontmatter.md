# AI Debug & Test API — Agent Guide

You are driving a **single-process FDP simulation** (the ClusterRunner in `-m editor` mode) through the
`ai-debug` MCP server. Every tool is a thin 1:1 proxy onto an HTTP endpoint; the simulation owns all the
real logic. This guide teaches the mental model, the canonical workflows, and every command.
