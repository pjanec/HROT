# RESUME — backend lane

⚠ A STATE doc: verify every line against git before acting on it.

## 1. Where it stands (`2026-10-02`)

- Branch **`backend`**. Last batch: [`HANDOFF_Ownership_Remaining_Work.md`](batches/HANDOFF_Ownership_Remaining_Work.md) → report [`REPORT_Ownership_Remaining_Work.md`](batches/REPORT_Ownership_Remaining_Work.md).
- Ownership programme: S1–S8 built; live matrix §5.7.1 **E1–E8 all ✅** (E8 = the multi-process crash reclaim, +10.2 s, no message).
- Done this batch: `CE-3003` (debug writes ask the owner), `CE-3004` (CGF polls mission acks), `CE-516` (editor uses the injected offline factory), `CE-518`'s 11 unit reds (all stale tests).
- Backend id block `CE-3000`–`CE-3999`, **next free `CE-3008`**. Every `behaviors` merge conflicts on the id-block table: keep their behaviors row and our backend row.

## 2. Waiting on the user

| id | question | lean |
|---|---|---|
| `CE-3006` | no host composes `NavigationSolverModule` ⇒ path requests are never answered, vehicles steer `Direct` | 🔒 user `2026-10-03`: MuscleGround implements a POC solver, but ONLY after a design discussion on how SimHost represents terrain (debug stand-in for a real MuscleGround host). ⛔ do not start |
| `CE-3007` | after a crash an IG creator reclaims Muscle/Perception descriptors it has no components for ⇒ nothing publishes them, other nodes keep stale samples | to be handled later (user `2026-10-03`) |
| `CE-524` | where the `NavState` write belongs | wait for `CE-3006`; then the writer goes under MuscleGround and the scale-out hop reuses `PathRequestBatch`/`PathResponseBatch` (design §5.9) |
| `CE-513 (backend)` | animation channels have two writers | architect question [`Q80`](Architect_Question_80_Animation_Channel_Ownership_Split.md): split request/status like stance, executor contract unchanged, small backend batch |
| `CE-518` (rest) | the whole `Hrot.ClusterRunner.Integration.Tests` run is order-dependent | gate by class `--filter` until someone isolates the shared state |

## 3. Tooling notes that cost time

- Multi-process cluster: `HROT_E2E_PORTS="SimHost=8102,Scenario=8101,IG=8103" python3 scripts/ownership-e2e.py …` (runbook §1.2 launch; use a non-zero `-d` domain).
- `ddsmonitor` is not preinstalled: `dotnet tool install --global cyclonedds.net.ddsmonitor`, run `~/.dotnet/tools/ddsmonitor` with `DOTNET_ROOT=/usr/local/dotnet`. A SIGINT leaves the JSON array unterminated: parse it sample by sample.
- `scripts/find.sh` reported 0/0 for a `\b…|…\b` pattern that plain grep matched in 40 files: do not trust its zero for alternations.
